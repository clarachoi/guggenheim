      <h1>What is a Cottage Garden?</h1>
      <p class="box">
        Originally, the purpose of <span class="italic">the cottage garden</span> was to provide food.  It contained livestock, herbs, fruits and vegetables.  Flowers were an optional extra and tended to be ones that had some practical value, such as seasoning food or repelling bugs.  The cottager's small plot did not allow for any wasted space, so the garden was abundantly packed, but well tended.
      </p>
      <p class="box">
        <span class="under">The cottage garden</span> later moved away from being an utilitarian space and became an area to be enjoyed.  These days, food-crops and chicken-keeping are returning and environmental concerns are being incorporated by the conscientious cottage gardener.
      </p>
      <p class="box">
        Although there are no hard and fast rules as to what should be grown, the hallmarks of this style are informality, abundance and diversity.  That means lots of colour, scent, bees, birds and <span class="under">butterflies, not to mention fruit, herbs, vegetables, frogs and hedgehogs!</span>
